Payment Processor Challenge
***

***

### Example of POSTMAN call

Call URL https://localhost:44302/api/pay/ with POST
with JSON:
```json
{
	"creditCardNumber": "5402 6326 4830 4155",
	"cardHolder" : "Dragos Durlut",
	"expirationDate" : "2021-01-02",
	"securityCode" : "123",
	"amount" : 21
}
```

***

### DB Creation

- Set db connection string in appsettings.json 
- Open Package Manager Console
- Set project to Entity. 
- Set Startup project to WepApi.
- Run command update-database

DB should be created

# Requirements
## Coding exercise:

Write a WebAPI with only 1 method called "ProcessPayment" that receives a request like this

- CreditCardNumber (mandatory, string, it should be a valid CCN)

- CardHolder: (mandatory, string)

- ExpirationDate (mandatory, DateTime, it cannot be in the past)

- SecurityCode (optional, string, 3 digits)

- Amount (mandatoy decimal, positive amount)
***
Write a Payment domain/entity with the same properties as the request and a second entity to store the

payment state (pending, processed, failed). Use Entity framework code first approach, write entity

configurations and generate the migrations.
***
The response of this method should be 1 of the followings based on

- Payment is processed: 200 OK

- The request is invalid: 400 bad request

- Any error: 500 internal server error

- The request should be validated before processed.
***
The payment could be processed using different payment providers (external services) called:

- IExpensivePaymentGatewa or

- ICheapPaymentGateway.
***
The payment gateway that should be used to process each payment follows the next set of business rules:

a) If the amount to be paid is less than £20, use ICheapPaymentGateway.

b) If the amount to be paid is £21-500, use IExpensivePaymentGateway if available. Otherwise, retry

only once with ICheapPaymentGateway.

c) If the amount is > £500, try only PremiumPaymentService and retry up to 3 times in case payment

does not get processed

d) Store/update the payment and payment state entities created previously once the processing is

completed.

### Bonus:

- Use repository/unit of work patterns

- Use eager loading for all entities

- Apply DDD practices and concepts

### Recommendations:

- The classes should be written in such a way that they are easy to test.

- Write enough unit tests to cover the developed code (at least 1).

- Use SOLID principles.

- Use any IOC you think is best.

- Use Entity Framework.

### Optional:

- Use AutoMapper or other mapping tools of your choice

- Use .Net Core to develop the WebAPI and Entity Framework Core.
